# Coffee Overflow

An interactive project that helps visualize coffee data in fun ways!

## Description
This is a project made as part of the CART 451 course at Concordia University.\
The project is an is an interactive Unity app that uses a dataset about coffee production and consumption quantities around the world on a yearly basis. \
There are multiple 3D environments that are used as a point of comparison against the large amounts of coffee beans and liquid for each year. The production data fills the environments with coffee beans, and the consumption data floods them with coffee.\
There is also a planet Earth model that showcases the top producers of coffee beans around the world and displays the data for each one.
