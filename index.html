            <h3>WEEK 1</h3>
            <h4>Question: About me</h4> 
            <b>Answer: </b> My name is Pascal and I am studying comp sci, I have a Sound Design degree, but I haven't done much with it.<br>
            I consider myself to be a person that has many ideas all the time but struggles with bringing them to life. <br> I came to Montreal to 
            study sound design to learn how to produce music, but that wasn't working out so I deviated into doing sound design for movies and videogames,
            which is how I ended enrolling into Computer Games here at Concordia. I consider myself mostly an introvert, but for the past few years I have been opening up
            more and more, which is nice.
        </p>
