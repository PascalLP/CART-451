            <h3>WEEK 1</h3>
            <h4>Question: About me</h4> 
            <b>Answer: </b> My name is Pascal and I am studying comp sci, I have a Sound Design degree, but I haven't done much with it.
            <br>
            I consider myself to be a person that has many ideas all the time but struggles with bringing them to life. 
            <br> 
            I came to Montreal to study sound design to learn how to produce music, but that wasn't working out so I deviated into doing sound design for movies and videogames,
            which is how I ended enrolling into Computer Games here at Concordia. I consider myself mostly an introvert, but for the past few years I have been opening up
            more and more, which is nice.

            <h3>WEEK 3</h3>
            <h4>Question: Crowdsourcing</h4> 
            <b>Answer: </b> Crowdsourcing in the age of internet is now a very accessible and profitable solution to problems where many inputs or a lot of content is needed.
            <br>
            As seen in the article by Jeff Howe, stock images is an field that has exploded due to the rise of crowdsourcing, there is no need to look for proffesional photographers that do this job for a lot more money,
            since there are libraries that will most likely have what the client is looking for, and for a lot less money.
            <br>
            Another field where crowdsourcing has turned out to be very beneficial is Research & Development for companies. Websites like InnoCentive and NineSigma let companies
            who are struggling finding solutions to their problems find them with the help of outside a companys team. 
            <br> 
            Some disadvantages of all of this external content is that a lot of it is low quality or just useless. The more content there is, the harder it is for quality content to be found and stand out from the crowd.
            It is also the case that people try to make easy money by offering work services on websites but delivering very lazy results and basically just scamming users. This hurts the reputation of the websites and the practice in general.
        </p>

            <h3>WEEK 4</h3>
            <h4>Question: AI as a creative tool.</h4> 
            <b>Answer: </b> Allison Parrish thinks that poetry is to expose readers to the infinite variablility and expressiveness of language, and has made made many projects in order to showcase this. 
            <br>
            I believe that the projects she has worked on serve as a great use of AI and Machine Learning to expose us to language ideas we may have never come up with, because as humans, we have reached a point
            where we use the same language and expressions.
            <br>
            I do not believe AI generated content will have any future soon, literature is a domain that requires human creativity in order to be good and appealing to readers. Projects like the ones Allison created, such as the multiple poetry generators,
            are simply tools to showcase different uses of our language to maybe spark and idea in someone or at least make us appreciate the flexibility of language sometimes.
